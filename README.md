# Brain-Tumor-Classification

## Introduction
Tumors are groups of abnormal cells that form lumps or growths. They can start in any one of the trillions of cells in our bodies. Tumors grow and behave differently, depending on whether they are cancerous (malignant), non-cancerous (benign) or precancerous. In this project we will detect whether Brain tumor is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). This program is designed to first select image from dataset. And upon detecting the image it will observe segmentation and classify the results. And at last it will evaluate accuracies.

We use Kernel SVM, K-means clustering, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Usage
•	Run BrainMRI_GUI.m

•	Select images from dataset

•	Observe segmentation and classification results

•	Evaluate Accuracies

## Dataset
The datasets consists of T2-weighted MR brain images in axial plane and 256 × 256 in-plane resolution, which were downloaded from the website of Harvard Medical School (URL: http://med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/), OASIS dataset (URL: http:// www.oasis-brains.org/), and ADNI dataset (URL: http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/). We choose T2 model since T2 images are of higher-contrast and clearer vision compared to T1 and PET modalities.
